## Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a product reviews dataset, offering insights into customer preferences, sentiments, and pricing dynamics.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The dataset underwent rigorous cleaning, including the removal of missing values, adjustment of data types, and elimination of special characters to enhance usability.

## Top Categories and Subcategories

Identified the top 5 main categories and corresponding subcategories, providing a foundation for targeted analysis.

## Customer Ratings and Insights

Average customer rating is 4.1, with Tablets in the computer & accessories category achieving the highest rating at 4.6. Scatter plot analysis reveals pricing trends and their impact on customer ratings.

## Discounts and Weighted Ratings

Electronic category (headphones) has the highest discount (around 70%), and musical instruments and electronics received the highest weighted ratings, offering insights into consumer perceptions and preferences.

## Correlation Matrix

Highlights strong correlations between rating and weighted rating, as well as actual price and discounted price, crucial for strategic decision-making.

## Regression Analysis

Utilizing a linear regression model, successfully predicted prices with an impressive R2 Score of 0.93. Coefficients provide valuable insights into factors influencing product pricing.

## Sentiment Analysis

Employed a Naive Bayes model for sentiment analysis on review text data, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.66%. Emphasizes the challenge of imbalanced data.

## Overall Reflection

This project showcases the versatility of data science techniques in extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets, providing a holistic view for informed decision-making.

## Future Work

Considerations include addressing class imbalance in sentiment analysis and exploring additional features for predictive modeling, enhancing the accuracy and applicability of insights.
